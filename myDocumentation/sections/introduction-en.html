<p> Activities in construction and renovation projects are related to a variety of different kinds of entities: building
objects, information entities, resources, and the environment. These relations have been identified in the area of lean
construction (Koskela, 1999, 2000), (Garcia-Lopetz, 2017). In the following figure different categories of flows are
presented:

<p> Each activity has a number of flows but no necessarily in all the categories shown in the figure. For instance, in
the design stage the activity-flows are mostly information entities and labor - equipment, spaces, materials, or
environmental conditions do not have relevance to office activities.  Moreover, there can be multiple flows of
each type. An activity may require multiple different equipment, labor crews, materials or information entities for
their execution.  </p>

<p> To model the logic of workflows, it is not sufficient merely to know which ingredients they have.  Activities are
transformations that are chained one after another based on the state changes they create.  For instance, smoothing of a
wall is an activity that transforms the wall surface from rough to even, and painting of the wall is an activity that
requires that the surface is even.  This creates a precedence constraint between the smoothing and painting activities.
To make it possible to represent the transformation logic of construction processes, there is a need to represent the
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>conditions</b> that an activity requires to hold for it to be executed; they can be
  <ol>
    <li>preconditions: conditions that should hold at the start of the activity</li>
    <li>execution conditions: conditions that should hold all over the execution</li>
  </ol>>
  </li>
  <li><b>effects</b> that the execution of the activity brings to hold</li>
</ol>

<p>
The figure above shows examples of all of these type of relations. All flows have associated conditions - both
preconditions such as proper location and execution conditions such as reservation - and
one flow has an effect that activity produces. 
</p>

<p> From the perspective of workflow management, activities have many properties - such as different kinds of resources
and execution times - that are gradually specified in the planning and scheduling process. The possible values are,
however, restricted by a set of constraints. The constraints can restrict the mutual values of different flows, or the
conditions and effects of activities, as shown in the following figure: </p>

<p> The figure shows that the activity <em>transport1</em> is of type <em>Transport</em> and have relation
<em>occupies interval</em> with a <em>time:Interval</em>. The activity has a set of variable properties:
<em>hasActor</em>, <em>hasObject</em>, <em>hasEquipment</em>, <em>hasOrigin</em>, and <em>hasTarget</em>. The
time interval has two variable properties: <em>hasBeginning</em> and <em>hasEnd</em>. The possible values of these
variables are restricted by a set of constraints. The actors are restricted to those with the capability of driving
(<em>CapabiityRequirement</em> constraint), the vehicle is restricted to one that has sufficient load carrying
capacity (<em>LoadCarryingCapacity</em> constraint), and the origin and target of transportation have to be different
locations (<em>DifferentValue</em> constraint). The mutual values of beginning and end of the interval are also
restricted by a <em>MinTemporalDistance</em> constraint, based on the duration to drive from origin to target. The
activity <em>transport1</em> is also related to a number of <em>StateConstraint</em>. They have been organized in
the figure into three different groups: the conditions that need to hold at the start of the activity, the conditions
that need to hold during its exexution, and the effects that will hold in the end of the activity.  </p>.
