The Digital Construction Processes defines the main subclasses of processes
(<tt>dice:Process</tt>): activities (<tt>dicp:Activity</tt>), behavior
process (<tt>dicp:BehaviorProcess</tt>) and service
(<tt>dicp:Service</tt>). Activities represent discrete intentional processes
with a start and end time, with instances ranging from projects and
phases to construction tasks. Behavior processes are ongoing processes dealing,
for instance, with occupants behavior. Services are ongoing processes
that interact with clients.
