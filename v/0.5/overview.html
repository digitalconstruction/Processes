<p>
The Digital Construction Processes defines the main subclasses of processes
(<tt>dice:Process</tt>): Activity (<tt>dicp:Activity</tt>), Behavior
process (<tt>dicp:BehaviorProcess</tt>) and Service
(<tt>dicp:Service</tt>). Activities represent discrete intentional processes
with a start and end time, with instances ranging from projects and
phases to construction tasks. Behavior processes are ongoing processes dealing,
for instance, with occupants behavior. Services are ongoing processes
that interact with clients.

<p>
Activities are central entities in the management of construction and
renovation projects as they have connection to a range of other
entities as presented in the figure below.
